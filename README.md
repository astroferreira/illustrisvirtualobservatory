The Illustris Virtual Observatory is a program developed from Dr. Paul Torrey (ptorrey@mit.edu) and Dr. Greg Snyder's (gsnyder@stsci.edu) sunpy module (https://github.com/ptorrey/sunpy) for "opening, manipulating, and plotting mock galaxy images produced with SUNRISE." Here this code has been updated to Python 3.6 and compiled as a runnable, command-line program.
