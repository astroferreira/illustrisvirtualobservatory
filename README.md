The Illustris Virtual Observatory is a program developed from Dr. Paul Torrey (ptorrey@mit.edu) and Dr. Greg Snyder's (gsnyder@stsci.edu) [sunpy module](https://github.com/ptorr\
ey/sunpy) for "opening, manipulating, and plotting mock galaxy images produced with SUNRISE." Here this code has been updated to Python 3.6 and compiled as a runnable, command-l\
ine program.
