# Installation

>Dependencies required: numpy, matplotlib, astropy, cosmocalc, scipy, gc, wget

After downloading the main directory and saving it to your computer, we can first run the program called **setup**. This will download any dependency that the program requires as well as open up a page to the [Illustris Galaxy Observatory](http://www.illustris-project.org/galaxy_obs/) where mock galaxies from the Illustris simulation can be viewed. The **ID** for a given galaxy can be found to the left of its image. This **ID** will later be used to specify which galaxy you'd like for simulated observations.
