# Illustris Virtual Observatory
The [Illustris Virtual Observatory](https://tjmetivier.github.io/illustrisvirtualobservatory/) is a program developed from Dr. Paul Torrey (ptorrey@mit.edu) and Dr. Greg Snyder's (gsnyder@stsci.edu) [sunpy module](https://github.com/ptorrey/sunpy) for "opening, manipulating, and plotting mock galaxy images produced with SUNRISE." Here this code has been updated to Python 3.6 and compiled as a command-line program.
